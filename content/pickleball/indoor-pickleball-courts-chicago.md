When it's cold or rainy, indoor courts are perfect. You need a park district membership and friends to fill the game, so these games are mostly for locals. 

You can post on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1781983742045018/) to find other players, and call or visit the park to find out when to play.
