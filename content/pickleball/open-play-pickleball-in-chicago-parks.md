The best place to start is open play at Chicago Park District courts. There are welcoming players from spring to fall. There are free locations, but many courts have a registration fee. Check the city's [activity search](https://anc.apm.activecommunities.com/chicagoparkdistrict/activity/search?onlineSiteId=0&activity_select_param=2&activity_keyword=pickleball) for more details. Bring your own paddle, but a friendly player might have a spare.  If you have more questions, the best way to get current and reliable information is to call the park.
