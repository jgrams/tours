A lot of pickleball happens on weekday mornings, but there are also games for working stiffs. Most evening and weekend pickleball costs a little money. To find games, you can:

- Check park district upcoming events, 
- Check [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/find/?slug=pickleball-in-chicago&keywords=pickleball&source=EVENTS&location=us--il--Chicago) for events
- Look at courts in suburban Chicago, they are often more active on the weekends.
