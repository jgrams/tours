## Outdoor Pickleball Courts

Park district outdoor courts are **free** and have regular players from spring to fall. A couple have permanant nets, but if the nets aren't permanant, someone unlocks the nets for open play. If you don't see open play times on the map, call the park and ask. Bring your own paddle, but a friendly player might have a spare.

## Chicago Park District Indoor Courts  

Indoor courts are perfect when it's cold or rainy. You need a park district membership and friends to fill the game, so these courts are mostly for locals. Call or visit the park and ask about times to play. You can post on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1781983742045018/) to find other players.
